Scala Indent file for Vim
=========================

Ugh... Scala's tough to indent; it's just too damn flexible.

This latest update appears to help things a little bit, but there's at least
one thing that it doesn't handle, so far:

  def removeDuplicates[a](xs: List[a]): List[a] =
    if (xs.isEmpty)
      xs
    else
      xs.head :: removeDuplicates(for (x <- xs.tail if x != xs.head) yield x)

    // This indents to the 'else', not to the previous 'def'
    def main(args: Array[String]) {

The above was pulled from the 'fors.scala' example file in the scala 2.8.1
distribution.  The problem with the above is that the 'if' statement is actually
the end of the entire function definition, but we don't know that.  If it were a
'brace' then we'd know how to find it due to the new 'LineCompletesBrackets' but
it's not.  The 'LineCompletesBrackets' function is able to use Vim's
searchpairpos() function but it's more difficult to make that work with
'if/else' given above.

The good news is that it's pretty easy to fix the above in your own code by
sacrificing that syntax.  Do this instead:

  def removeDuplicates[a](xs: List[a]): List[a] = {
    if (xs.isEmpty)
      xs
    else
      xs.head :: removeDuplicates(for (x <- xs.tail if x != xs.head) yield x)
  }

  // Now it indents properly
  def main(args: Array[String]) {

If anyone's got any bright ideas on how to fix that up cleanly, please take some
time to hack away at the indent file.
